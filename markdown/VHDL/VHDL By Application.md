# VHDL By Application

In this section, VHDL building blocks are introduced in order of building complexity.
This gradual introduction of complexity is designed to give a new VHDL developer confidence as
they build up an general feeling for VHDL as a hardware description language and as a tool
for building digital designs.

We'll be examining these modules not such as code but also reviewing the digital circuitry the code creates.  
This is the biggest stumbling block when learning VHDL, don't let yourself forget that you are describing
hardware, not just writing code.  Everything you write must be synthesisable (unless writing the simulation testbench of course).

All modules are available for download and have accompanying simulation testbenches.  It's a good idea to download these modules
examine the code and the simulated output in greater detail to further your understanding.
