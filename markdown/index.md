# Welcome to VHDL Development

This website is for those learning or working with VHDL.
The focus is on learning by application.  Instead of examining the syntax of VHDL, this site is more concerned with what we can make using VHDL.  There are other resources or textbooks that already do an excellent job teaching VHDL as a language, but there are few resources available that demonstrate how it can be used.  There is little attention paid to any building blocks that are left by the wayside as soon as we start developing digital circuits for real.  You won't find any explanation of Karnaugh maps here because I've already long forgotten how to use them.  I hope to teach VHDL by providing clear demonstrations of how it can be used, with well written examples of fundamental building blocks that are required for a wide variety of designs.

After grasping the basics by reading and testing examples of real designs, I will take a more in-depth look at actually designing for real hardware and the challenges that can be encountered on FPGAs.

For those readers that already have a firm grasp of VHDL, I hope I can provide ready to use building blocks that can be used in your designs as a block box, leaving you with more time to focus on coding application specific modules.
